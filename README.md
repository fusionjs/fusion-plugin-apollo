Fusion.js entry point for React universal rendering w/ Apollo

// ./src/main.js
import React from 'react';
import App, {ApolloClientToken} from 'fusion-apollo';

export default function() {
  const app = new App(<Hello />);
  app.register(ApolloClientToken, ApolloClient);
  return app;
}
```

---

### API

#### Registration API

##### ApolloClientToken

```js
import {ApolloClientToken} from 'fusion-apollo';
```

A plugin, which provides an instance of [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/apollo-client.html), to be registered and used as within the Apollo Provider. You can use [fusion-apollo-universal-client](https://github.com/fusionjs/fusion-apollo-universal-client) as a barebones Apollo Client token.

##### GraphQLSchemaToken

```js
import {GraphQLSchemaToken} from 'fusion-apollo';
```

Define the `GraphQLSchemaToken` when using a locally hosted GraphQL endpoint from within a Fusion.js application. Connect your schema to a Fusion.js server with [fusion-plugin-apollo-server](https://github.com/fusionjs/fusion-plugin-apollo-server). You can find an example schema in the [graphql-tooks repo](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools#example).

#### App

```js
import App from 'fusion-apollo';
```

A class that represents an application. An application is responsible for rendering (both virtual DOM and server-side rendering). The functionality of an application is extended via [plugins](https://github.com/fusionjs/fusion-core#plugin).

**Constructor**

```flow
const app: App = new App(el: ReactElement);
```

* `el: ReactElement` - a template root. In a React application, this would be a React element created via `React.createElement` or a JSX expression.

**app.(register|middleware|enhance|cleanup)**

See the [fusion-core app methods](https://github.com/fusionjs/fusion-core#app) for further information on provided methods. Fusion-apollo does not add additional app methods besides the inherited fusion-core methods.

#### Providers

As a convenience, fusion-apollo re-exports providers from fusion-react. You can find additional information on those as follows:

* [Provider](https://github.com/fusionjs/fusion-react/blob/master/README.md#provider)
* [ProviderPlugin](https://github.com/fusionjs/fusion-react/blob/master/README.md#providerplugin)
* [ProvidedHOC](https://github.com/fusionjs/fusion-react/blob/master/README.md#providedhoc)
