// Apollo currently does not have an effective error policy for server side rendering (see https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/issues/2680)
// This render function first tries to use `renderToStringWithData`. If any query in this render function fails, we will catch the error, log it, and
// fall back to a standard renderToString, which will set the `loading` props of all queries which failed to execute in the first pass to true.
// This allows us to still render with data in the happy case, and defer to client side rendering if any queries fail. This also acts as a form
// of retrying from the browser.
